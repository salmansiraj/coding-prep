Load balancing: 
    * Help distribute traffic 
    * Routes client requests in a number of different web servers 
    * Figuring out which machine can have more load and send there 

Caching: 
    * For repetitive queries, add in a memory cache
    * Content Delivery Networks -> Global network of servers for image/videos/css so you would 
        have more room in your own server


Database Index: 
    * Way of sorting number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field 
        will create another DS which holds the field value, aand a pointer to the record, 
        this allows binary searches to be performed on it 
    e.g. Finding users in your location, you would index the Lat/Long in order to find

To prevent duplicates in database: 
    * Find a way to separate into two tables and have a table connecting the two 
    * CUSTOMERS <--> ORDERS <--> PRODUCTS

Primary Keys:
    * Field that uniquely identifies a row in a table 

Foreign Keys: 
    * Field that unique identifies a primary key /row to another table
    * Foreign keys in a taable can make up bring a primary key if there's restrictions

Sharding database: 
    * Horizontal sharding used to split a table (that is getting bigger and 
        bigger like tweets) across multiple machines
    * Vertical sharding used to split tables across different machines (users, products, etc.)

Replication: 
    * Duplicating records in the database in case of servers going down.
    * Replication on write and update can happen at the same time.

-----
NoSQL: 
    * Key, value pair models, naturally able to scale (chat)
    * Follows BASE 
    Basically Available: Guarantees availability 
    Soft State: System may change overtime 

SQL: 
    * For persistent needs and restrictions, using a relational database
    * Good Relational DB follows ACID 
    Atomic: Transaction containing other operations as well, to make sure all layers succeed 
    Consistency: Transaction is valid based on rules and doesn't corrupt data 
    Isolation: Can concurrently run multiple queries at the same time
    Durability: Persistent data, once its in there it will stay there

Questions -
* what type of load are we handling?
